# vanilla-doom
[Doom emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) configuration for a vanilla taste.

The main changes are some keybinds (help changed to `f4` and `c-h` is backspace to match terminal keybinds) and we turn off `evil-mode` and restore the fringe to it's vanilla glory.

## Install
Install doom emacs then copy this config to `~/.doom.d/` or wherever your config lives.
